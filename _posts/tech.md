Technology adapting for human or human adapting to technology

Is a question very similar to eternal egg vs hen paradox.

The inherent purpose of technology is to add convienience to the life but in order to enable that one needs to learn and adapt to the technology.

But where does the balance of expectation lies?

Especially from a users perspective, especially when the technology is still far from perfect, especially when the user in not born in the technology embedded world but has already lived many decades before this technology is introduced?

From the society perspective Technology has established its strature as being precise and perfect. Anyone who works with the technology knows for sure that it is far from truth and we make humans make bad technoloy all the time with equally likelihood as we make bad coffees. But that is not the narrative that reaches the public shpere all the time, especially to those who are new to those technology.

So what can we do?

Working as a technology coach at CITL, I have encountered the question of how we can be make the people adapting to our inperferct technology more comfortable? I think soeme of the ways we need to reiterate are 

> We should revert the assumption that the technology is perfect and people experienceing problems are people in need of support to learn that.

No the technology is most likely not designed properly and problems are for obvious reasns of the lack of good user interface. It is the not the people who need support with the technology but rather our tecnology that need a justification

> We should be humble on the technology

temporary solution as some feature and putting the liability on the user for not getting in right in first place.
