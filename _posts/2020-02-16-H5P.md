[H5P](https://h5p.org) is an open technology that allows you construct interactive HTML components. You can use them to embedd in your course website to provide your students with 
interctive lectures instead of plain old reading lists. The H5P community is active and growing fast. You can see many [examples](https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications) on the website for ideas.
Here is a small demo I implemented for the H5P make-a-thon that we are organising at CITL. As a technology coach we all contributed a demo each.
